/**
 * 1. Given a array of integers find the index which partitions the array to two with high numbers
 * and low numbers. For example [5, -1, 3, 8,6] the index 3 will partition the array to [5,-1,3] and
 * [8,6] all the numbers in the second partition are greater than first. The solution has to work in
 * O(n).
